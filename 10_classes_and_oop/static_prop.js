//In JavaScript, static methods are defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. This means you can call a static method directly using the class name, without needing to create an instance of the class.

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Static method
  static hello() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford");

// Calling the static method using the class name
console.log(Car.hello()); // Output: Hello!

// Trying to call the static method on an instance will result in an error
// console.log(myCar.hello()); // Uncaught TypeError: myCar.hello is not a function
```

// In this example:
// - The `hello` method is defined as a static method using the `static` keyword.
// - You can call `hello` using `Car.hello()`, but not `myCar.hello()` because `hello` is not available on instances of the `Car` class¹².

// Do you have any specific questions about static methods or how to use them in your projects?
